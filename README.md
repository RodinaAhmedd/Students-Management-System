📚 Student Grades Management Script

A simple JavaScript program that manages student grades, calculates statistical results, and allows users to search for a specific student's grade.
This script demonstrates the use of arrays, loops, conditions, and user input handling in JavaScript.

🚀 Features

Displays all students with their corresponding grades

Calculates:

Total grades

Average grade

Highest grade

Lowest grade

Determines whether each student passed or failed

Allows the user to search for a student by name

Shows the result using alert() if the student is found or a "Not Found" message otherwise

🧠 Technologies Used

JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

Browser execution via prompt() and alert()

📌 How It Works

The program defines two arrays:

studentsNames[] containing student names

grades[] containing corresponding grades

It loops through the grades to:

Display each student’s grade

Calculate the total & average

Determine pass/fail status

Track the highest and lowest grade

The user enters a name through prompt()

If the name exists, the script shows the student’s grade using alert()

Otherwise, it alerts that the student is not found
