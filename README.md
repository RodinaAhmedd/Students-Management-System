📚 Student Grades Management Script
A simple JavaScript program that manages student grades, calculates statistical results, and allows users to search for a specific student's grade.
This script demonstrates the use of arrays, loops, conditions, and user input handling in JavaScript.

🚀 Features
- Displays all students with their corresponding grades
- Calculates:
  - Total grades
  - Average grade
  - Highest grade
  - Lowest grade
- Determines whether each student passed or failed
- Allows the user to search for a student by name
- Shows the result using alert() if the student is found or a "Not Found" message otherwise

💫 Technologies Used
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- Browser execution via prompt() and alert()

📌 How It Works
1. The program defines two arrays:
- studentsNames[] containing student names
- grades[] containing corresponding grades
2. It loops through the grades to:
- Display each student’s grade
- Calculate the total & average
- Determine pass/fail status
- Track the highest and lowest grade
3. The user enters a name through prompt()
4. If the name exists, the script shows the student’s grade using alert()
5. Otherwise, it alerts that the student is not found

📥 How to Run
1. Create an .html file
2. Inside the <script> tag, paste the JavaScript code
3. Open the HTML file in your browser
4. The program will prompt you to enter a student name

✨ Future Improvements
- Case-insensitive search
- Sorting students by grade
- Displaying results in a webpage instead of console/alerts
- Adding input validation
